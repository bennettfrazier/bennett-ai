## Overview
A Next.js Gen AI chatbot clone entirely with v0.dev in less than a day's worth of effort.

This project was built because I wanted to see how I could test out the AI SDK built by Vercel using V0 as a starting point.

Bennett AI is inspired from Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, and other Gen AI chatbots.

## Project features:
- Message streaming to display API response as it comes in
- Message reasoning with auto expansion, collapse, and scrolling
- Message response markdown styling using Tailwind Typography
- Welcome screen component that loads a random welcome message on page load
- Animations while response is "thinking"
