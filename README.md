## Overview
A Gen AI chatbot entirely built with v0.dev in less than a day's worth of effort.

This project was built so I could see how to test out the Vercel's AI SDK using V0.dev as a starting point.

Bennett AI is inspired from Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, and other Gen AI chatbot interfaces and interactive elements.

## Quick Start

### Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bennettfrazier/bennett-ai.git
   cd bennett-ai
   pnpm install
   ```

### Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` and add your Anthropic API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)
   
   To get an API key, go to [Anthropic's Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and follow sign up instructions.

### Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Available Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
